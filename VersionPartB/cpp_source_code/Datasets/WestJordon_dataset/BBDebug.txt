!!!   Cal: update upper bound from (node UB)99999 to a new 15.4
   Node 0 with LB =-99999 UB= 15.4
Find an active node 0 with a  UB cost = 15.4 LB cost = -99999
   To be branch: pax 1 with 0 competing vehicle
   To be branch: pax 2 with 0 competing vehicle

Optimal Cost is 15.4 Number of Nodes checked = 1
